         <h2>About the Teacher as Art-maker Project (TAP)</h2>


         <div class="abstract"> 

            <div class="collapse"> 
           <p>
             The Teacher as Artmaker Project (TAP) is a significant research initiative conducted at the
             <a href="//education.unimelb.edu.au/">Melbourne Graduate School of Education</a>
             &nbsp;(MGSE). Visual Art teachers are somewhat unique amongst the teaching fraternity in that they not only teach, but they must also practice what they preach. Many wish to maintain a private art practice in partnership with quality teaching; in fact, a lot of art teachers believe that their own art making is critical to ‘quality teaching’. However, we all know that this is not an easy task.

         <p>
           TAP is an international first for Visual Art Education, providing for the first time, longitudinal data on teacher’s participation in art production, perceptions of quality of teaching, and expectations of retention in the profession. This information will inform better teacher training and professional development for future generations of art educators. TAP participants come from successive cohorts of MGSE’s
           <a href="./?a=567129">Master of Teaching</a>
           (Secondary Art) program. All participants complete an annual survey once they graduate, regardless of their career pathway. A number of volunteers from that group also agree to participate in an annual art exhibition that provides participants with the goals, motivation, and support group to maintain an active art practice during the early years of their teaching career. We welcome you to discover TAP’s exhibitions, artist-teachers and research results.

         Each year, the TAP holds a curated art exhibition in a professional gallery, for project participants. This provides artist-teachers with the goals, motivation, support group to maintain an active art practice during the early years of their teaching career, and enables opportunities for professional and professional development. All the works of art in the exhibitions are created by recently graduated secondary Visual Art teachers, who display their diverse private art practice. Unique to the exhibitions are the informative and insightful commentaries on the role that art-making plays in their teaching. The exhibitions demonstrate how MSGE, through its
         <a href="./?a=567129">Master of Teaching</a>
         program, encourages quality of teaching during the early years of a career, foster teachers’ ongoing passion for their subject-disciplines, and is concerned for the retention of quality graduates in the teaching profession. The exhibitions attract a large number of visitors to its opening nights and shows, and are enjoyed by artists, academics, educators, arts professionals and the general public alike.
