 <p class="intro">
   All research projects involving humans are subject to review and prior approval by The University of Melbourne
   <a href="http://www.research.unimelb.edu.au/humanethics" rel="external">Human Research Ethics Committee</a>
   (HREC). Research involving human subjects can not and must not proceed until clearance has been obtained.
 </p>
 <p>
   The HREC has established sub-committees and Advisory Groups to review staff and student ethics applications. The Graduate School Human Ethics Advisory Group (GSHEAG) suggests that you read the information below on the procedures for submitting an ethics application, taking particular note of the GSHEAG scheduled deadline. The GSHEAG strongly advises you to visit the HREC website to obtain information about the processes and the requirements of successfully completing an ethics application.
 </p>
 <p>
   Administration within MGSE is provided by the Research Ethics Officer, Mr Tim Mattingsbrooke [8344 8662], who is happy to provide advice and assistance.

 <h3>Ethics Applications and Procedure</h3>
 <h4 class="collapsible label" id="content101">Who should complete an application?</h4>
 <div class="accordion-content"> <strong>Staff</strong>
   <p>
     All researchers who are members of staff of the Graduate School, who aim to conduct research which involves humans as participants, must submit an application to the GSHEAG for review and approval.
   </p>
   <strong>Students</strong>
   <p>
     All postgraduate students in the Graduate School of Education who are enrolled in a thesis subject, and are gathering data from human subjects must submit an application to the Graduate School Human Ethics Advisory Group (GSHEAG) for review and approval. In the case of student projects, the student completes the ethics application in consultation with their supervisor . The application form must be read and signed by the supervisor (as the Principal Investigator) before being submitted. Project applications must also have the approval of the relevant Human Ethics Sub-Committee, of the Human Ethics Committee (HREC) before undertaking any research involving human subjects. In the case of Education projects, this is usually the Humanities and Applied Sciences Sub Committee (HAPS).
   </p>
 </div>
 <h4 class="collapsible label" id="content201">What are 'high risk' and 'low risk' projects?</h4>
 <div class="accordion-content">
   <p>
     For ethics purposes, projects are classified as being either 'high risk' or 'low risk' depending on the nature of the enquiry being undertaken and the nature of the participants. As a general indication, projects involving children, persons undergoing medical treatment or any person likely to be seen as vulnerable will be 'high risk'. Projects involving consenting adults with non-controversial subject matter will be 'low-risk'. The online process through Themis will make these distinctions clearer, and will usually ensure that the appropriate forms are used. Low-risk projects generally take less time to approve than high-risk.
   </p>
 </div>
 <h4 class="collapsible label" id="content3">On-line application through Themis: Where do I log in?</h4>
 <div class="accordion-content">
   <strong>All ethics applications are lodged through the Themis Ethics module, as follows:</strong> 
   <ol>
     <li>
       Log in to
       <a href="http://www.themis.unimelb.edu.au/" rel="external">www.themis.unimelb.edu.au</a>
       for the online form
     </li>
     <li>Click on UOM Research Service</li>
     <li>Click on Human Ethics Workbench</li>
     <li>Follow the instructions</li>
   </ol>
 </div>
 <h4 class="collapsible label" id="content4">
   How can students submit an on-line application through Themis?
 </h4>
 <div class="accordion-content">
   <strong>Students must first be eligible for a Themis account</strong>
   <p>
     Student access to the Themis Human Ethics module is now available for "research-active" students [those enrolled in a recognised research degree, such as the PhD]. Students will be assigned the Responsibility of UOM Research Student Self-Service. For the Human Ethics module this will give them access to the same functionality as staff researchers – namely the Human Ethics Workbench, Meeting Schedules and Reporting functionality. Students who are not research-active cannot access Themis. It is possible for individual students to have their status set to "research active", either individually or as a cohort.
   </p>
   <strong>The Themis account must then be activated</strong>
   <p>
     Students activate their Themis account via Account Registration System (ARS) just as Staff do. They will need the following information to activate their Themis account:
   </p>
   Full name
   <br> 
   Student number
   <br> 
   Date of Birth (format is DD-MON-YYYY)
   <br> 
   Postcode of home residence
   <br> 
   Library BarCode
   <p>
     Using this information, the student logs in to the Accounts Registration System (ARS):
     <a href="http://accounts.unimelb.edu.au/" rel="external">http://accounts.unimelb.edu.au</a>
   </p>
 </div>
 <h4 class="collapsible label" id="content5">When should I submit an application?</h4>
 <div class="accordion-content">
   <p>
     Deadlines for submission are devised each year by the Melbourne Graduate School of Education Human Ethics Advisory Group (MGSE HEAG).  As a guide, new ethics applications submitted by the below stated cycle deadline, take about eight to nine weeks to approve.
   </p>
   <strong>For 2014, the deadlines are as follows:</strong>
