  <p>Penalty for exceeding the word limit on assignments in MGSE to apply from semester 2, 2012. These guidelines apply to all written assignments set in postgraduate programs in MGSE.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>All students will indicate on the front of each assignment the number of words, inclusive of footnotes but not references, contained in the assignment.</li>

    <li>At the discretion of the Board of Examiners, assignments that exceed the word limit, inclusive of footnotes but not references, will attract a marking penalty that is 5% of the total available marks for each 10% that the number of words exceeds the word limit. For example an assignment that is 10% over the word limit attracts a penalty of 5% of the total available marks, 20% over the limit attracts a penalty of 10% of the total available marks, 30% over attracts a penalty of 15% of the total available marks.</li>

Grading Criteria</h3>

<div class="accordion-content">
  <p>The following grading criteria was approved at MGSE Program Co-ordination Working Group on 27 May 2013 and are to be used in all MGSE graduate coursework programs from the start of semester 2, 2013 onwards.</p>

  <h3>Grade Descriptions</h3>

  <p>The following grade descriptions are intended to indicate in general terms the kind of achievement to be expected at each Grade Level, and in no way replace assessment criteria for individual tasks. They are indicative and not prescriptive: a different mix of qualities may well justify a different grade in different cases. Their wording at times implies written, discursive tasks, and staff grading other kinds of tasks in areas such as the Arts, Health and Physical Education, and Computer Education will need to project the qualities implied onto the different tasks they are assessing.</p>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Since all work must meet the requirements of satisfactory expression, presentation and referencing (see above), these matters are not all mentioned in the grading descriptions below.</p>

  <h4>H1 (80-100)</h4>

  <p>This grade is awarded to exceptional work, which:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Demonstrates a capacity to work with abstract and original concepts and the ability to relate these to practice;</li>

    <li>Illustrates a deep understanding of the major relevant theoretical perspectives;</li>

    <li>Is thoroughly researched, with the data or scholarship collected discriminately from a wide range of sources;</li>

    <li>Interprets data and sources critically and rigorously;</li>

    <li>Possesses a sophisticated structural control in presenting and developing ideas and in drawing conclusions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>H2A (75-79)</h4><strong>This grade is awarded to work of a very high standard, which:</strong>

  <ul>
    <li>Demonstrates the ability to analyse and integrate a broad range of relevant sources;</li>

    <li>Illustrates an understanding of a range of theoretical perspectives;</li>

    <li>Is well-researched, the data being and scholarship collected selectively from a wide range of sources;</li>

    <li>Interprets the data and sources consistently and perceptively;</li>

    <li>Is well-structured, developing logically to conclusions that reflect the evidence and/or arguments presented.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>H2B (70-74)</h4><strong>This grade is awarded to work of a high standard, which:</strong>

  <ul>
    <li>Shows evidence of research, through selection of relevant sources;</li>

    <li>Uses sources accurately, identifying connections between them;</li>

    <li>Includes evidence of the ability to draw implications from theory;</li>

    <li>Demonstrates the ability to draw conclusions from data or other sources;</li>

    <li>Possesses a structure that consistently addresses the topic.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>H3 (65-69)</h4><strong>This grade is awarded to sound work, which:</strong>

  <ul>
    <li>Shows evidence of research and demonstrates some understanding of appropriate sources;</li>

    <li>Demonstrates understanding of the main issues in the topic;</li>

    <li>Presents data or insights relevant to the topic which are succinctly summarised, although often no more than paraphrased;</li>

    <li>Generally supports its contentions with appropriate evidence;</li>

    <li>Possesses a structure that addresses the topic.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>P (50-64)</h4><strong>This grade is awarded to satisfactory work, which:</strong>

  <ul>
    <li>Shows understanding of the task;</li>

    <li>Presents data or insights that are relevant to the topic, but these might rely on source material, with little transformation to demonstrate understanding;</li>

    <li>Generally addresses the topic and organises some of the ideas clearly;</li>

    <li>May lack sufficient or appropriate analysis;</li>

    <li>May include contentions that are not properly supported with appropriate evidence.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>N (0-49)</h4><strong>This grade is awarded to unsatisfactory work, which may:</strong>

  <ul>
    <li>Be conceptually unsound;</li>

    <li>Show evidence of not having understood the task properly;</li>

    <li>Be largely irrelevant;</li>

    <li>Derive unsustainable or no conclusions from the data presented;</li>

    <li>Include unjustified claims;</li>

    <li>Possess an incoherent structure.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h3 class="collapsible label" id="content9">MGSE assignment re-submission guidelines</h3>
<div class="accordion">
  <p>The following guidelines were approved at MGSE Program Co-ordination Working Group on 22 July 2013 and are to be used in all MGSE graduate coursework programs from the start of semester 2, 2013 onwards. </p>
<p>Students may be offered the chance to resubmit work if they receive a mark between 45% and 49% for either an individual assignment or the subject as whole.  In exceptional circumstances students who receive a mark between 40% and 44.9% for their work may be offered a chance to resubmit. Work that is resubmitted can be awarded a maximum mark of 50%</p>

<p>Re-assessment will not be available to students who fail a subject or individual assignments due to late submission of assignments.</p>
</div>


<h3 class="collapsible label" id="content10">MGSE assignment re-marking guidelines</h3>
<div class="accordion">
  <p>The following guidelines were approved at MGSE Program Co-ordination Working Group on 22 July 2013 and are to be used in all MGSE graduate coursework programs from the start of semester 2, 2013 onwards. </p>
<p>With the exception of double marking required for failed assessment, examiners/assistant markers are obliged to mark each piece of assessment only once.</p>
<p>Students who are unhappy with their mark should initially discuss the mark with their lecturer/tutor and if they wish to pursue a claim of an error in academic judgment by an assessor, the chair of the examination board must determine whether the original mark was appropriately determined according to established marking criteria</p>.

</div>


<h3 class="collapsible label" id="content8">Unsatisfactory progress</h3>

<div class="accordion-content">
  <p>At the end of each semester the academic progress of each student is reviewed. Students who have made unsatisfactory progress will be identified and asked to meet with the Course Unsatisfactory Progress Committee (CUPC).<br />
  Graduate students will be considered to have made unsatisfactory progress when they:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Fail any subject;</li>

    <li>Fail to meet the conditions imposed on their enrolment by the CUPC or the Academic Board;</li>

    <li>Reach the maximum course duration, including any approved amendments without completing the requirements of the course in which they are enrolled;</li>

    <li>Withdraw after the census date from all subjects in the current teaching or grouped period for the second time.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Notification</h4>

  <p>Students who make unsatisfactory progress at the end of a semester will be officially notified via email (as well as a letter in the post), after results for that semester have been released. They are then asked to hand in a &#39;Written Submission&#39; form to the Melbourne Graduate School of Education prior to their appointment with the CUPC.</p>

  <div class="col-6 block">
    <p>It is in students’ interest to submit their written statement and respond to the CUPC invitation. This is because the Committee is required to make a decision even with no response or attendance.</p>
  </div>
  <hr>

  <h3>Meeting preparation</h3>

  <p>Students may seek assistance in preparation for a CUPC meeting by:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>attending a MU Advocacy Service Information Session;</li>

    <li>attending a session at the Counselling Service;</li>

    <li>meeting with staff at Academic Skills to discuss strategies for improving study techniques if permitted to continue in the course;</li>

    <li>if appropriate, registering with the Disability Liaison Unit (DLU) for support and assistance;</li>

    <li>meeting with a Student Adviser at the Graduate School of Education to discuss strategies for putting a case forward, and gathering the supporting documentation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Meeting with the CUPC</h4>

  <p>Prior to a CUPC meeting, the CUPC will read through a student’s written submission to gather information on circumstances surrounding unsatisfactory progress.<br />
  During the meeting, a student is asked several questions to determine the factors that have contributed to their performance. The decision of the CUPC will be made based on a review of results, and the extenuating circumstances - such as personal difficulties, financial hardship and study problems - that have been presented to them in the meeting, or through written submission. If a student is permitted to continue their enrolment, the CUPC may also suggest strategies to improve academic progress in future semesters.</p>

  <h4>CUPC outcomes</h4>

  <p>After the CUPC meeting, the CUPC will determine the best course of action for the student’s academic future and make one of four decisions:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>take no action (student is allowed to stay enrolled in the course without restrictions for the next teaching period);</li>

    <li>Restrict the student’s enrolment for the next teaching period;</li>

    <li>temporarily suspend the student’s enrolment;</li>

    <li>terminate the student’s enrolment indefinitely.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If the outcome of CUPC is termination of enrolment, a student has the right to appeal on certain grounds to the University Academic Board.</p>

  <div class="col-6 block">
    <p>Note: If a student does not appeal, or if their appeal is unsuccessful, they will lose their place in the course. Students are able to reapply for the course in the future, but must demonstrate academic rehabilitation before they are able to be re-admitted.</p>
