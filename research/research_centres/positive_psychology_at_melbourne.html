      <h3 class="first">Welcome to Positive Psychology at Melbourne</h3>

      <p class="col-3 first">Positive Psychology at the Melbourne Graduate School of Education has been in development for some time and the team are enormously proud to launch this exciting initiative in 2013. The Centre aims to promote the interest, education and application of positive psychology in Australia, through leading collaborative research, teaching and engagement, and the development of world-class initiatives and programs.</p>

      <h4 class="collapsible label" id="content310">About Positive Psychology</h4>

      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>Positive psychology (PP) is a relatively new field of social science that conducts research into the flourishing and optimal functioning of individuals, groups, and institutions. It focuses on the strengths, virtues, beneficial conditions, and processes that contribute to well-being. It is the study of what allows people to operate at the peak of their potential: to live longer and healthier, to participate in more satisfying relationships, and have more engagement, meaning and purpose in life. It is also the study of what makes communities and organisations stronger, more resilient and more virtuous.</p>

        <p>Ground-breaking research now shows that raising our levels of wellbeing simultaneously raises our creativity, productivity and willingness to contribute to broader societal purposes. Positive psychology tools and techniques have been successfully applied across sectors such as education, health, finance, business, sport, performing arts and the armed forces.</p>

        <p>Although the official advent of positive psychology was in 1998, the field builds on a long history linking back to one of the original psychologist, William James, at the turn of the 20th century. The idea of psychologists helping people to achieve their fullest height in order to thrive as individuals and to use their gifts, talents and virtues to help others was also a big theme in the 1950&#39;s Humanistic Psychology Movement and was important in the 1980&#39;s Coping and Adaptability Psychologies.</p>

        <p>Often people ask us the question, ‘What is the difference between positive psychology and ‘psychology as usual’?</p>

        <p>We must be careful not to draw binary distinctions between positive psychology and traditional psychology as there are many topics that overlap both fields such as the topics of resilience, flow, motivation and mindfulness. However, the basic distinction put forward in the literature is that traditional psychology has a healing orientation and thus seeks to heal/fix pathology and problems. In contrast, positive psychology follows a strength-based orientation and seeks to promote positive states and qualities in individuals and groups.</p>

        <p>While understanding and alleviating sickness and depression is a worthy goal, it only addresses part of the well-being equation. As such, positive psychology helps us to gain a more complete picture of human nature.</p>

        <p>As a discipline, positive psychology has grown more than any other field of psychology over the past two decades. Moreover, research that adopts positive psychology experimental techniques has spread into many other fields such as sports science, public health, business and neuroscience. The scientific study of human flourishing has increased by 415% over the past 2 decades.</p>

        <p>The Center for Positive Psychology at MGSE offers a multi-disciplinary approach to positive psychology and conducts research across many topics and sectors.</p>

      <div class="accordion">
        <p>Welcome to Positive Psychology at Melbourne</p>

        <p>Established with the generous support of John Higgins through the inaugural Gerry Higgins Chair, this centre will make a significant contribution to the field of positive psychology.</p>

        <p>The centre benefits from a strong team with an impressive record of research and practice, including Associate Professor Lea Waters and Dianne Vella Brodrick. We have also been fortunate to enjoy ongoing advice from Professor Martin Seligman as a member of our steering committee, considered by many to be the ‘father’ of positive psychology.</p>

        <p>Positive psychology is an incredibly exciting field, and it is growing at a fast pace. I look forward to watching the work of this centre add value to our society, and make a positive impact on individual lives.</p>

<li><strong>Natalie Brain scores again:</strong> The teaching evaluations have just come in for our second year positive psychology subject 'Positive Communities and Organisations' which was co-ordinated by Natalie Brain. The subjects scored 4.7 out of 5 and students made comments such as &quot;This was the best subject I have taken in my two years at uni, and has contributed a lot to making this semester the best one yet&quot; and &quot;I loved the learning community -  how the culture evolved into one where everyone was happy to see each other and comfortable chatting when we walked into tutorials and lectures, rather than an awkward keep-to-yourself atmosphere.&quot;</li>

<li><strong>Grant success for Dianne, Gavin and Lea:</strong> The positive psychology team has been awarded a University of Melbourne Teaching and Learning Grant for an innovative project that will set up Mentor relationships between our postgraduate students in the Masters of Applied Positive Psychology and and our third year undergraduate students from the subject 'Positive leadership and Careers'. The mentoring relationships are designed to guide our third year subjects about their future careers using the principles of positive psychology.</li>
