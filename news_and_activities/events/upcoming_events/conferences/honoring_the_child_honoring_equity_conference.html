This project is to develop Aboriginal understandings for improved social and emotional wellbeing in the Aboriginal communities of Broome and Perth. Concepts of cultural continuity and social and emotional wellbeing will be compared and validated by the Aboriginal communities of Perth and Broome through a series of focus groups and community meetings. Indigenous mental health statistics are of grave concern and different approaches that encompass locally derived Aboriginal knowledges and how these can be actioned are essential. The outcomes of this research will inform programs, services and policy to better meet the mental health needs of Indigenous people.</p>

      <p><strong>Background</strong><br />
      She was the Head of the Centre for Aboriginal Studies at Curtin University, for some 19 years, leading the field in providing culturally appropriate education.</p>
      <p>As well as leadership in Indigenous higher education, she has also had significant involvement in psychology and Indigenous issues for many years. She has undertaken much work and many publications in this area and is considered one of the &lsquo;founding&rsquo; people in Indigenous people and psychology. She is involved in many organisations and of note; she was inaugural Chair of the Australian Indigenous Psychologist&rsquo;s Association. She is a currently a research fellow at the School of Indigenous Studies at the University of Western Australia, researching Aboriginal women and leadership.</p>

      <p><strong>Keynote Title &amp; Abstract</strong><br />
        <strong><em>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Perceptions of Social and Emotional Well Being</em></strong></p>
      <p>Aboriginal people have suffered through the effects of colonisation and dispossession. While these impacts have varied according to patterns of settlement, all Aboriginal people are living out the consequences of these impacts in their contemporary lifestyles. There is recognition that traditional Western mainstream public health approaches have failed Indigenous people and this is largely due to interventions having little or no understanding of Indigenous people&rsquo;s realities and exclusion of Indigenous people in these. Despite the resources made available for addressing Indigenous mental health, a gap remains between the Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations. This presentation will overview Aboriginal concerns and solutions, propose ideas of culturally appropriate concepts of Indigenous mental health and examine how the Aboriginal community perceives these and how they can be addressed and strengthened. This will include a discussion about the need for holistic approaches that are owned by the community, also Aboriginal understandings of domains of social and emotional well being that include connection to family, to community, to culture, to ancestry, to land and spiritually. These domains will be examined and Indigenous perceptions of what needs to be strengthened to create healthy cultural environments for Indigenous children will be discussed.</p>

      <p><em>Faculty of Education, University of Waikato</em></p>
      <p></p>
      <p><strong>Biography</strong><br />
        Linda Mitchell is an associate professor (Early Childhood Education) at the University of Waikato. She was project leader for the longitudinal evaluation of New Zealand&rsquo;s strategic plan for early childhood education 2004, 2006 and 2009 and is currently leading an evaluation of the Ministry of Education&rsquo;s early childhood education Participation Programme. A key aspect of this evaluation is interviews with families about their views and experiences of early childhood education. Her recent research includes a community research project with Congolese refugee families examining experiences of resettlement, aspirations for their children and views about early childhood education and care, research undertaken in collaboration with teachers analysing multi-modal literacies, a literature review on outcomes of early childhood education, national surveys of early childhood services and research investigating quality in parent/whānau (family)-led services.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Keynote: Early childhood provision: Democratic communities for citizenship and social justice?</strong></p>
     <p>How might policy and practice enhance early childhood care and education services as democratic communities for citizenship and social justice? In such provision, children are positioned as members of a social group and wider community, and families&rsquo; funds of knowledge are valued and woven into the fabric of the curriculum. Early childhood care and education is valued as a public good and a child&rsquo;s right. These ideas can be linked to policy and curriculum. It is crucial to examine them in a world where childhoods are changing rapidly, discrepancies in wealth are evident both between and within countries, and commercialisation and marketisation are becoming hallmarks of provision in many countries. Several writers have argued that new ways of constructing children that emphasise citizenry rights are needed to enable responsiveness to these and other changing conditions of childhoods and to living in a democracy.</p>
      <p>This paper draws on research undertaken by the author and a body of international research to analyse what a construct of the &ldquo;child as citizen&rdquo; implies for developing policy frameworks and pedagogy to support democracy and citizenship. Tactics and strategies for change are examined. An innovative project undertaken by a coalition of early childhood organisations in New Zealand to develop a shared vision for community-based provision is used as an example to argue that researchers, academics and practitioners all have a responsibility to work collectively and individually for policy changes. Challenges for practitioners may mean letting go of power and exploring their practice with their own communities and in response to social and economic change. The paper also illustrates small tangible steps being made through research with refugee families and a community action group in planning for an integrated children and family centre to address aspirations of refugee and migrant families.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Workshop: Enquiring teachers and responsive pedagogy</strong></p>
        <p>A body of international evidence has highlighted the very positive outcomes that can accrue from participation in early childhood education – benefits for children and also for families and society. In parallel, considerable interest has emerged in policy frameworks to encourage access to education and care, and support and sustain responsive pedagogy. The comprehensive country reviews done by the OECD in 2001 and 2006 have emphasised the roles of curriculum, pedagogies, teacher education and access of staff to professional development and resources.</p>
        <p>This workshop presents findings from recent New Zealand policy evaluations to examine the impact of policy initiatives on participation. My main argument will be that a range of policies focused on improving teacher qualifications and professional capabilities and developing communities of learners provided conditions for teachers&rsquo; engagement with theory and pedagogical discussion with others – including parents, teachers, and external academics. These were key to shifts that started to occur in New Zealand&rsquo;s early childhood landscape towards more open and democratic provision.</p>
        <p>This presentation sets the scene for participants to examine and compare their own policies and practices, and how they might incorporate ideas about the teacher as learner and researcher within their settings.</p>

      <p><em>Program Director, CIP – Centre for Interactive Pedagogy</em></p>
      <p></p>
      <p><strong>Biography</strong><br />
      Zorica Trikic is Program director in one of the most influential NGOs in Serbia, CIP- Centre for Interactive Pedagogy and program specialist in International Step by Step Association operating in 29 countries (Central, South East Europe, Eastern Europe and Central Asia).</p>
      <p>Zorica has more than 25 years of experience<strong> </strong>in the early year&rsquo;s sector, working with children, parents, communities, educators and policy makers. Her focus was always on developing and implementing psychosocial and educational programs to support children and families facing most challenging life experiences such as armed conflicts, extreme poverty, social exclusion and oppression in Serbia, Balkan region, Central Asia and ex Soviet Union countries. She strongly believes (and has proof) that education has power to transform broader society and that educators are agents of change with capacity to go beyond their traditional roles - they can name realities in which children live and injustices they face, they can give voice to silenced groups of children and parents and initiate alliances in order to create more justice and equity.</p>
      <p>In the last 20 years she has worked on Roma education issues – establishing and supporting work of community based kindergartens in Roma settlements; introducing Roma Teaching Assistants in the educational system in Serbia; building partnerships with Roma communities, Roma leaders and Roma NGOs; personal and professional empowerment of members of Roma community, especially Roma woman and mothers. She is one of the main researchers in EU MAP project &ldquo;Monitoring Equal Access to quality Education for Roma in Serbia&rdquo; and first-author of a National report on Roma Early Childhood Inclusion. She is one of the authors of an education for social justice program implemented in 29 countries and member of different international professional groups working on issues of peace building, equity, respect for diversity and early years programming.</p>

      <p><strong>Keynote Title &amp; Abstract<br />
        <em>Being an educator in times of crisis – challenges and opportunities</em></strong></p>
      <p>While the world is facing one of the biggest economic crisis many not so visible, but endangering practices are establishing. Is it by accident that just now world leaders are stating that the project of multiculturalism has failed?</p>
      <p>The recent situation with Roma population all over Europe is opening many questions and can be used as an example for what we want to address and stress. We are more or less silent bystanders as we watch unacceptable practices occur, such as building walls around Roma settlements (old fashioned ghettoes with more sophisticated justification), forced evictions, expelling people over the night from their homes and transporting them to their native countries, closing the borders, committing atrocities on them… Is the present situation of Roma heralding the future of all who are poor, undereducated, different…?</p>
      <p>This keynote speech will explore potentials and strengths of education and educators to create a change not only for children and families but also for society in general. It will focus on both professional and personal empowerment of educators as key adults who work with children, but at the same time share the same/similar problems as the children and families they are working with... It will be illustrated with examples from the practices established in Eastern Europe and Balkans during and after wars and ethnic clashes in conditions of extreme poverty and uncertainty.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Workshop: &quot;Dreams we have for our children, what we can do to make them come true&quot;</strong></p>
      <p>&ldquo;Like a bridge over troubled water I will lay me down…&rdquo; The lyrics of the famous song written by Simon and Garfunkel in late 60s may become (and in our case was) a moto for key adults in years to come... But can we as educators do that if we are overwhelmed with our own problems... What do we need and from whom to become more balanced and strong...? Is there a topic around which everybody can gather and share beyond class, ethnic background, race, gender?</p>
      <p>This experiencial workshop will showcase one practical, simple but powerful activity which can be used to provide psychosocial support to educators working in times of crisis, support them to reconnect with core values of their profession, gain and give empathy and focus their attention on themselves, as well as to every child and all children they are working with. During the activity and exchange the model naming - voicing - building allies will be presented and explored.</p>

      <p><strong>Keynote Title &amp; Abstract<br />
      <em>Linking Global to Local in the Lives of Children and Families: Impacts of Neoliberal Policy</em></strong><br />
      This paper draws from collaborative projects with colleagues in Kenya, Greece, South Africa and the USA to connect global (neoliberal and neocolonial) policies to local lives and experiences of families and children. Parent and child narratives from Kenya convey the unintended consequences of development/dependency patterns in relation to policies of the World Bank and IMF and the inherent contradictions in &ldquo;education for all.&rdquo; Roma families and children in Greece have continued to inhabit the margins of social society and access to education, though recent initiatives have begun to address their social and educational inclusion in more effective ways. Black parents in South African townships reflect on the persistent racism and social exclusion in post-apartheid education policies and &quot;integrated&quot; school practices. Finally, a brief discussion of how U.S. and Arizona policies, including English-only, anti-immigrant, and banning of Ethnic Studies curriculum, impact efforts to build alliances and work for social justice. Ally strategies and decolonizing methodologies are also discussed.</p>
      <p>This paper documents links between globalized neoliberal policies and their impacts on programs and people in the context of local, state and national early childhood policy regimes –with emphasis on direct impacts on families and children in often marginalized groups. It draws from several studies (over the past two decades) in which I have sought to link global policies and struggles to local impacts, as well as from my experiences in anti-oppressive and social justice work in diverse communities. The paper unpacks unintended consequences, including good sense/bad sense contradictory impacts several U.S. state and federal policy initiatives, and also draw from research done internationally.</p>
      <p>My analysis intends to complicate the discussion of model and management issues using nuanced and often contradictory observations of how state and national policies embody elements of good sense/bad sense (Gramsci, 1971) and reflect persistent hegemonies of power, privilege and neoliberal policy, even as they attempt to be &ldquo;inclusive&rdquo; and more &ldquo;democratic.&rdquo; My analysis builds upon previous early childhood policy analysis and critiques of neoliberal policy impacts (e.g., Dahlberg &amp; Moss, 2005; Perkins, Nelms &amp; Smyth, 2004; Ryan &amp; Lobman, 2007; Swadener, 2003; Swadener, Kabiru &amp; Njenga, 2000).</p>
      <p>Drawing from a critical analysis of experiences with/in changing state and national early childhood systems, I adapt Antonio Gramsci&rsquo;s notions of common and good sense to analyze the hybrid discourse propelling these initiatives and (re)consider the roles, problems and opportunities of specialist intellectuals in both perpetuating common sense (i.e. uninterrogated, assumed and often contradictory) notions of &ldquo;good&rdquo; early care and education and inclusive education campaigns, and acting as interlocutors to engage with colleagues in search of good sense approaches. I join other scholar-activists to rethink our analysis of understanding &ldquo;the Neoliberal turn&rdquo; and its impacts on the field&rsquo;s engagement with policy issues and structures that intimately affect people&rsquo;s lives. Specific discourses and policies include narrowing definitions of quality and readiness, eligibility issues in obtaining support with childrearing, and use of standardized accountability measures and some of the many unintended consequences directly affecting families and communities. I also draw upon postcolonial theory and decolonizing methodologies.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em><strong>Workshop: Children&rsquo;s rights and voices in cross-cultural contexts</strong></em></p>
      <p>This workshop draws from research focusing on children's rights and voices in several nations, with an emphasis on child consultation and participation in diverse communities.Children&rsquo;s rights, as defined by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC, 1989), are examined in all their ramifications: as discourse, as law, as constitutive commitments, and as a set of policies and services that impact the everyday life experiences of children. I will share examples from countries, municipalities (including earlier work in Melbourne), and organizations that have strong public commitments to children&rsquo;s rights, have created and established key infrastructures and universal entitlements to promote child and family well-being, and enacted policies to end child poverty and promote the &ldquo;progressive realization&rdquo; of children&rsquo;s rights.</p>
<p>Implications for children in marginalized communities are emphasized. I will also draw examples of child consultation from a recent longitudinal study of children and families in Arizona. Participants will share ways in which their programs and research may take child rights-based approaches or aspire to do so.</p>
