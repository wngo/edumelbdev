      <p class="intro">This project aims to shed new light on Australian strategies of knowledge-building and on agendas for future policies and practice. Taking physics, history and graduate competencies across the learning cycle, across institutional/equity differences and across three states, it investigates experiences, strategies and conceptions of knowledge-building today. Two fundamental internationally-debated issues for the 21st century are taken up: disciplinarity versus attribute-centred approaches to knowledge; and knowledge development from school to undergraduate to research training. The project will produce new evidence and insights on changes now in train and the ways in which knowledge-building is being developed, recreated or weakened by them.</p>

        <p><em>Knowledge Building in Schooling and Higher Education</em> is funded as an ARC Discovery Project 2011&ndash;2013. The project aims to undertake a qualitative and focused investigation of current Australian practices in history, physics and cross-program competencies across the learning cycle and takes up two central questions in relation to schooling and higher education:</p>

        
          <p>1. Is the emphasis on learning outcomes and on auditing and managing education achievements in schooling and higher education distorting and undermining knowledge building?</p>

          <p>2. How should we think about knowledge today?</p>
        
 

     

        <p>The project develops from and builds on a previous ARC project focused on changes in the school curriculum over the past four decades. The former project showed the ambivalence today about how to conceptualise knowledge and knowledge-building, and what emphasis to give to it, in school curriculum policies, in comparison with attention to accountabilities and testing the basics, and concern with development of an employable person for the future. In particular, education systems were having difficulty reconciling the need to think about foundations, with a concern about the future and rapid changes of both knowledge and employment forms.</p>

        <p>The project will study Australian policy texts and formulations, and practitioner perspectives and experiences of the knowledge-building agenda, in three fields of knowledge (history, physics and graduate attributes/cross-disciplinary competencies); in three state contexts (Vic, NSW and Qld); and across three levels of the education system (secondary schooling; undergraduate higher education; and research training postgraduate education). Through textual analysis and a large body of interviews, it will address questions relating to conceptions of knowledge, assessment and auditing effects and differential approaches and effects between states, between different kinds of institutions and between countries grappling with these issues.</p>
   

     

  
        <p>In terms of significance, the project will provide one important means of assessing the strategies Australia has been taking in relation to knowledge-building across higher education, and will contribute to progress on major globally recognised questions for the future. The need to give fresh attention to knowledge and the work of schools and universities in the 21st century is evident in the research literature not just in education, but in sociology and social theory, philosophy, political science and economics.</p><strong>This project will deliver new evidence and new insights in relation to the following:</strong>

        
          <p>1. What approaches, conceptions of knowledge, priorities are now being developed within the teaching of history and physics in secondary schooling, undergraduate, and postgraduate research-oriented education?</li>

          <p>2. How are cross-disciplinary, outcomes and attributes agendas impacting on institutional thinking in each stage?</li>

          <p>3. What concepts of disciplinarity, new knowledge and capabilities are now at work in these phases, and with what coherence or problems?</li>

          <p>4. Across the phases, and in relation to a focus on knowledge (as distinct from access), what differences are evident between elite and non-elite institutional contexts, and with what social equity implications?</li>
        

        <p>The project aims to provide new empirical evidence about what is being set in train in history, physics and cross-program competencies across the learning cycle in Australia, and contribute fresh analyses to Australian policy and institutional interests as well as to international thinking and research on these questions.

      <h3>Work in Progress</h3>

      <h4 class="collapsible label" id="content-1">Project Management and Establishment</h4>

      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>Appointments of research fellows for this project were finalized in late March 2011 and the project effectively commenced in May that year. The setting up phase of the project involved literature reviews, ethics submission and approval, and setting up project data management and communications processes. Since July 2011, the research team has also worked to bring together an initial sourcing and analysis of professional bodies and associations&rsquo; policy documents and websites in terms of their positioning in relation to disciplinarity, competencies and outcome agendas and their framing in terms of knowledge building from school to doctorate. This work will continue into 2013 and is being presented in a range of formats as set out below.</p>
      </div>

      <h4 class="collapsible label" id="content-2">Project Interviews</h4>

      <div class="accordion-cotnent">
        <p>Interviews for the project began following ethics approval in August 2011 and are continuing through 2012. The project involves interviews of academics and teachers who work in physics, history or cross-disciplinary agendas at different kinds of institutions across the states of Victoria, NSW and Queensland. We are seeking to find out about practitioner thinking and practice in relation to knowledge, knowledge building and fields of work, and are asking questions about educational background, current teaching and research (where appropriate) and experiences of change. At the end of 2012 we had interviewed around 100 academics and teachers. Interviews will continue through to the first months of 2013, with a view to complete data collection by April 2013.</p>

        <p>Lyn Yates presented a seminar titled 'Researching the knowledge-building question across schools and higher education' at the University of Sydney at on 25 July 2012. The seminar outlined the context for the work of the project in relation to: (1) the impact of auditing and management practices on schools and universities; (2) debates about curriculum and knowledge in the 21st century as to the value of traditions and disciplines compared with learner-centred or problem-based or attribute-based approaches; and (3) the genuinely open and difficult question about what, in this contemporary and rapidly changing world, is the role of formal education.</p>

        <p>Lyn Yates presented two open lectures at the University of Oslo on 23 and 24 August 2012. The first lecture was titled ‘Curriculum politics and the knowledge question’ and discussed changing agendas of curriculum research over the last half-century, theories and movements that have been particularly influential, and the ways these have framed or challenged assumptions about knowledge and curriculum. The second was titled ‘Curriculum and capacity-building’ and discussed global movements and national responses, particularly in Australia, drawing on data from the KBP project to illustrate how the concerns with economic capacity building and social integration may be in tension with and even undermined by the new forms in which curriculum is publicly and politically discussed and governed and tested.</p>

       <p> Lyn Yates presented a paper titled ‘Curriculum and capacity-building: Some contemporary tensions’ at the 2012 European Conference on Educational Research on 21 September. Lyn’s presentation formed part of a symposium titled ‘What kind of curriculum agendas are being carried in today’s global curriculum movements’, which also included presentations from Michael Young, Johan Muller and Berit Karseth.

<p>In September, Lyn Yates and Kate O&rsquo;Connor attended the 2013 European Conference on Educational Research (ECER) in Istanbul. Lyn presented a paper titled &lsquo;Struggling with the role of the history subject in the school curriculum&rsquo; as part of a symposium on &lsquo;Knowledge agendas, humanities subjects and equity: Curriculum and policy reform&rsquo;. Kate&rsquo;s paper was titled &lsquo;New forms of online learning: Institutional policies and the framing of knowledge in changing times&rsquo; and was presented as part of the &lsquo;Emerging Researchers&rsquo; section of the conference.
<p>Lyn Yates and Kate O&rsquo;Connor visited the University of Oslo, Norway, in the last week of September. The visit was sponsored by the &lsquo;Higher Education: Institutional dynamics and knowledge cultures&rsquo; (HEIK) group of the Faculty of Educational Sciences. During the visit Lyn and Kate delivered a seminar titled &lsquo;Disciplinarity and the (re)structuring of knowledge in Australian universities&rsquo;. Further details regarding the seminar are available at <a href="http://www.uv.uio.no/english/research/groups/heik/HEIK_seminars/2013/heik-ac-seminar-2013-09-25.html">http://www.uv.uio.no/english/research/groups/heik/HEIK_seminars/2013/heik-ac-seminar-2013-09-25.html</a></p>
<p>Kate O&rsquo;Connor presented at the European Conference on Curriculum Studies (ECCS) which was held in Braga, Portugal on 18-19 October. Kate&rsquo;s paper was titled &lsquo;Curriculum content and the engagement issue: Problems for the sociology of knowledge&rsquo;.</p>

      <p><i>Summary:</i> This project investigated changes and continuities in approaches to curriculum over the past four decades and across state differences in their values and agendas for curriculum. It examined approaches to knowledge, to students and equity agendas, and to how academic and vocational agendas are marked out; as well as the forms by which curriculum policy and management are constructed and enacted. The project <a href="http://web.education.unimelb.edu.au/curriculumpoliciesproject/">website</a> includes a list of related publications and resources. Recent publications from this project include: <em><a href="http://www.mup.com.au/page/145">Australia&#39;s Curriculum Dilemmas: State Cultures and the Big Issues</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415575829/">World Yearbook 2011: Curriculum in Today&#39;s World</a></em>.</p>

      <p><strong>Educating the Australian Adolescent: An historical study of curriculum, student counselling and citizenship, 1930s-1970s</strong><br />
      2009-2011 Australian Research Council Discovery Project<br>

      <a href="http://www.findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/individual/person23602">Julie McLeod</a> , <a href="http://www.findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/individual/person71563">Katie Wright</a> , Sari Braithwaite, Sophie Rudolph</p>

      <p><i>Summary:</i> Educating the Adolescent is a cultural history of Australian secondary education in the middle decades of the twentieth century. It is examining scholarly and professional ideas about the purposes of secondary schooling, debates about the personal and civic values young people should embody, and ideals of citizenship and the kinds of social knowledge that schools should foster. The research takes a close look at i) curriculum programs and reforms, and ii) the development of guidance and counselling in schools. Combining documentary and oral history research, the project provides historical perspectives on these topical issues and will create an oral history archive for, and will deepen community and professional knowledge of, an important period of Australian educational history. Updates on the project and links to relevant publications are provided on the project <a href="eaa.html">website</a> .</p>

      <p><i>Summary:</i> The project is designed to support the objectives for schooling in Australia that have been identified by the Council of Australian Governments. These objectives are in the face of growing inequities in the distribution of educational resources, growing concentrations of students with high levels of educational needs, and imbalances in the distribution of resources across key stages, especially in early childhood education. By examining the ways in which federalism contributes to the structural barriers to these objectives and by developing and validating a set of structural reforms the project will contribute to these national objectives.</p>

      <p><i>Summary:</i> The growth of VET in Schools has been associated with government policy to promote an innovation culture and economy, to increase secondary retention, and to strengthen transition from school to tertiary study, training and work. This study seeks to examine the effectiveness of VETiS, from a gender and SES perspective, in strengthening participation, fostering student engagement and facilitating effective transition. It does so by analysing national VETiS data, followed up by a longitudinal study of students in 12 schools (small, large, single sex, co-educational, metropolitan and non-metropolitan). It uniquely combines a system-wide perspective with a detailed and qualitative school-level view.
